## About the Project

### Overview 

Sort Manager is my first application developed exclusively in Java. The aim of this project was to familiarize myself with standard software engineering practices such as OOP programming, SOLID software development, and the construction of an MVC application.  

The project itself included developing an application which was capable of implementing a range of sorting algorithms to sort numerous, random, data structures of varying length. The requirements for this application are as follows: 

* Implement Bubble, Quick, and Tree Sort algorithms :+1:
* Sort Arrays :no_entry:
* Sort Array and Linked Lists :+1:
* Sort Generic data types :+1:
* Time sorting process :+1:
* Compare algorithms :no_entry:
* Take user input :+1:
* Implement Model, View, Controller, and SOLID principles :+1:
* Exception handling and logging :+1:
* Utilize nested classes :+1:
* Complete, and comprehensive REAMME.md :no_entry:

As can be seen, not all of the initial requirements have been met as of yet. However, work on the project will continue in order to meet the final requirements in an extended time frame. 

### Built With

* Java
* Maven
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Git BASH

## Getting Started
